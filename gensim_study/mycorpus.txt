At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

If you're not comfortable using the command line right now, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions without using the command line, including:

Creating a repository
Forking a repository
Being social
However, if you find that you need to use Git, we can help you set it up!
